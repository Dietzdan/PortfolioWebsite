<h4 class="w3-center">SPI Sports Website Commission</h4>
<p> I was commissioned with my friends at Project XIV to create a website for Sports Performance Improvement or SPI for short.
    With Project XIV help we designed a website that they were happy with, which I then proceeded to make and iterate upon.
    I had a blast making this website I created using the skills I had learned from creating my portfolio website plus some new additions.
    One of the favourite parts is the overlay on the location pictures and the player photos allowing the users to have a description of the players without taking up space giving a nice clean gallery look.
    And it was a great test of my skills as I've also made a mobile version of the site so it can be accessed and viewed in its full glory on desktop and smartphone alike! 
    It's given me some ideas for revamping this website too. You can see the website for yourself

<h4 class="w3-center">Portfolio Website</h4>
<p> This site was created as a portfolio website to show the projects I have completed. It was created using a mixture of HTML,
     Inline CSS and ,the W3 schools framework, W3.CSS. The W3.CSS framework and Inline CSS is used to style the website into
     the way I want it to look. For example the side navigation bar was made using the w3-bar-block and w3-sidebar classes.
     Not only this but by using the framework this website is much more responsive meaning it will change layout depending on
     the size of the screen for example if you resize the window or are viewing this on mobile the side bar will be hidden and instead
     and faded top navigation bar is present. Lastly the icons are from Font Awesome allowing for the uses of instanly recognisable icons

    <h4 class="w3-center">PrettyMuch vs CNCO Shootout - Game Design</h4>
    <p>I was tasked with designing a simple penalty shootout game for two band's collaboration single. The client wanted the game
        to be browser based so it could be easily played on both on moblie and computer. This would also allow them to embed it into 
        their own website. My role in this project was to have a complete game on paper so it could be handed to the developers to make.
        This included the gameplay, menus , user interface , sounds , how scoring would work and other mechanics and game elements.
        You can play the game for yourself and see the competed product at 
        <a href="https://penaltyshootout.prettymuch.com/pcball.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;" target="_blank" > https://penaltyshootout.prettymuch.com/pcball.html </a>.
        <br>(Note:You will need to disable any adblock for the game to load)

    <h4 class="w3-center">PCG Galaxy Scene</h2>
    <p>The task was to create a procedurally generated scene in space.
        The idea for my scene was that it would be scavenger ships that are looting a recent battle that took place in a asteroid field.
        How the scene works is first the asteroids and debris fields would spawn in randomly genrated spiral pattern similar to a real galaxy. 
        Next the "Freighter" ships will spawn in they will travel to a random debris field at which point they will rise up and release the smaller "Collecter" ships 
        which go to a random piece of debris in field and then return to the big ships. The small details were my favorite part of this project such as the bob of the asteroids or the spinning debris. 
        There is also a small chance of the debris to explode when it comes in contact to a "Collecter" ship. Each time the scene is played something will change so the video is just one instance of the Galaxy Scene.

    <h4 class="w3-center">SnakeWear</h4>
    <p> The aim of the dissertation was to find a appropriate control scheme for the game snake if it was played on a smartwatch. 
        This project needed a few new skills. For example to put the game from Unity to the watch i first had to export it 
        then package the game using android studio this allowed me to add mobile and watch specfic things such as the turning of the sleep function 
        so the screen would never dim during play. The different control schemes were another learning experince the only controls
        I had made was keyboard or button oriented but now I was making a version with swipe and tilt version. In the end two results 
        came from my study the regualar touch controls were found to be the easiest however the swipe controls made the game more "fun" and enjoyable to the partcipants.
